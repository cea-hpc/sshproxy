Functional Tests
================

How is it working?
------------------

The functional tests are run with +docker-compose+. The +run.sh+ script is a
wrapper to automatically start the tests (e.g. when using +make test+).

Every container is created with the same +Dockerfile+ found in the
+fedora-image+ directory. All scripts started in the containers are located in
the +fedora-image+ directory.

The following containers will be created:

tester::
	where all tests are started. It executes a +go test+ program (cf.
	below).

etcd::
	where the etcd database is. It executes the +etcd.sh+ script which
	starts the etcd server.

gateway{1,2}::
	where sshproxy is installed/configured. It executes the +gateway.sh+
	script. The script builds and installs an sshproxy RPM package with
	the latest HEAD commit, creates a sshproxy configuration file and
	starts an SSH server.

server{1,2,3}::
	destinations configured in sshproxy. They all execute an SSH server.

The tests that run on tester use the Go test framework and can be found in the
+fedora-image/sshproxy_test.go+ file.

How to debug the tests?
-----------------------

To debug the tests, we can modify the definition of the tester container in
+docker-compose.yaml+:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
diff --git a/test/docker-compose.yaml b/test/docker-compose.yaml
index 65ae927..0621932 100644
--- a/test/docker-compose.yaml
+++ b/test/docker-compose.yaml

     gateway1:
         container_name: gateway1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then we start (and build if necessary) all containers:

	$ docker-compose up --build

Once every container is started, we can connect to the tester container:

	$ docker-compose exec tester /bin/bash
	[fedora@tester ~]$

We then use the +go test+ command to run the tests:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[fedora@tester ~]$ go test -v -failfast -tags docker sshproxy_test.go
