NAME
----
sshproxyctl - display and modify sshproxy information stored in etcd

SYNOPSIS
--------
*sshproxyctl* ['OPTIONS'] 'COMMAND'

DESCRIPTION
-----------

'sshproxyctl' is used to display the current state of *sshproxy*(8)
connections and host checks stored in etcd. It is also used to enable or
disable a destination host.

OPTIONS
-------

*-c CONFIGFILE*::
	Path to *sshproxy*(8) configuration file. Only the parameters for etcd
	are used. See *sshproxy.yaml*(5) for details.

*-h*::
	Show help and exit.

COMMANDS
--------

*help*::
	Show help and exit.

*version*::
	Show version number and exit.

*enable -all|-host HOST [-port PORT]*::
	Enable a destination host in etcd if the host was previously disabled
	by the 'disable' command (see below). If '-all' is specified instead
	of '-host', all the hosts present in the configuration are enabled. If
	no '-port' is specified, all the ports present in the configuration are
	used. 'HOST' and 'PORT' can be nodesets. If libnodeset.so (from
	https://github.com/fdiakh/nodeset-rs) is available, clustershell groups
	can also be used.

*disable -all|-host HOST [-port PORT]*::
	Disable a destination host in etcd. A disabled host will not be
	proposed as a destination. The only way to enable it again is to send
	the 'enable' command. It could be used for host maintenance. If
	'-all' is specified instead of '-host', all the hosts present in the
	configuration are enabled. If no '-port' is specified, all the ports
	present in the configuration are used. 'HOST' and 'PORT' can be
	nodesets. If libnodeset.so (from https://github.com/fdiakh/nodeset-rs)
	is available, clustershell groups can also be used.

*forget host -all|-host HOST [-port PORT]*::
	Forget a host in etcd. Remember that if this host is used, it will
	appear back in the list. If '-all' is specified instead of '-host',
	all the hosts present in the configuration are forgotten. If no '-port'
	is specified, all the ports present in the configuration are used.
	'HOST' and 'PORT' can be nodesets. If libnodeset.so (from
	https://github.com/fdiakh/nodeset-rs) is available, clustershell groups
	can also be used.

*forget error_banner*::
	Remove the error banner in etcd.

*error_banner [-expire EXPIRATION] MESSAGE*::
	Set the error banner in etcd. 'MESSAGE' can be multiline. The error
	banner is displayed to the client when no backend can be reached (more
	precisely, when all backends are either down or disabled in etcd).
	'-expire' sets the expiration date of this error banner. Format:
	'YYYY-MM-DD[ HH:MM[:SS]]'

*show [-all] [-csv|-json] connections*::
	Show users connections in etcd. Without '-all' only one entry per user
	is displayed with the number of her/his connections. If '-all' is
	specified, all connections are displayed.

*show [-csv|-json] hosts*::
	Show all hosts and their state in etcd.

*show [-all] [-csv|-json] users*::
	Show users statistics in etcd. Without '-all' only one entry per user
	is displayed. If '-all' is specified, users are split by services.

*show [-all] [-csv|-json] groups*::
	Show groups statistics in etcd. Without '-all' only one entry per
	group is displayed. If '-all' is specified, groups are split by
	services.

*show error_banner*::
	Show error banners stored in etcd and in configuration.

*show [-user USER] [-groups GROUPS] [-source SOURCE] config*::
	Display the calculated configuration. If a user is given, its system
	groups (if any) are added to the given groups. If a user and/or groups
	are given with '-user' and '-groups' options, the configuration will
	be calculated for these specific user/groups. If a source
	(host[:port]) is given with the '-source' option, the configuration
	will be calculated for this specific source.
