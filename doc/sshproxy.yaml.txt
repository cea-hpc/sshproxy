NAME
----
sshproxy.yaml - sshproxy configuration file

SYNOPSIS
--------
*/etc/sshproxy/sshproxy.yaml*

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*sshproxy*(8) reads its configuration from '/etc/sshproxy/sshproxy.yaml'. You
can specify another configuration as its first argument.

The configuration is in the YAML format.

The following keys can be defined:

*debug*::
	a boolean ('true' or 'false') to enable debug messages in the logs
	('false' by default).

*log*::
	a string which can be:
	- empty ('""') to display the logs on the standard output. It is the
	  default.
	- 'syslog' to save logs messages through the *syslog*(3).
	- a path to a filename. The directory must exist. The pattern '\{user}'
	  in the path will be replaced with the user login (eg.
	  '/var/log/sshproxy/\{user}.log'). The user is the owner of the
	  filename, so he needs the right to write in the specified directory.

*bg_command*::
	a string specifying a command which will be launched in the background
	for the session duration. Its standard and error outputs are only
	logged in debug mode. It is empty by default.

*manager*::
	a string specifying a manager to find the destination for a
	connection. The format is 'host:port'.  If the manager is unavailable
	or does not return a response the routes defined in the configuration
	will be used as a fallback.

*route_select*::
	a string specifying how the host destination will be chosen.  It can
	be 'ordered' (the default) or 'random'.  If 'ordered', the hosts are
	tried in the order listed until a successful connection is made.  The
	list is first randomly sorted if 'random' is specified (i.e. a
	poor-man load-balancing algorithm).

*dump*::
	a string specifying the path to save raw dumps for each user session.
	Empty by default. The path can (and should) contain one or more of the
	following patterns:
	'\{user}'::: replaced by the user login
	'\{sid}'::: replaced by the unique session id
	'\{time}'::: replaced by the connection starting time (e.g.
	  "2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00").

The subdirectories will be created if needed with the user as owner. So the
user needs to have the right to write in this directory. For example:
'/var/spool/sshproxy/\{user}/\{time}-\{sid}.dump'

It can also be a network address where to send dumps if specified as
'TCP:host:port' (the TCP is case sensitive), e.g.  'TCP:collector:5555'.

*stats_interval*::
	a string specifying the interval at which basic statistics of
	transferred bytes are logged.  It is empty by default. The string can
	contain a unit suffix such as 'h', 'm' and 's' (e.g. '2m30s').

An associative array *environment* can be used to set environment variables.
The pattern '\{user}' will be replaced with the user login:

	environment:
	    XAUTHORITY: /tmp/.Xauthority_{user}

An associative array *routes* defines the destination according to the
listening IP address of the SSH daemon:

	routes:
	    192.168.0.1: [host1, host2]
	    192.168.0.2: [host3, host4]
	    default: ["host5:4222"]

Each key is a listening IP address of the SSH daemon and the values are a list
of destination hosts (with an optional port). The special key 'default' can be
used to define a default route. The hosts are tried in the order specified in
the previously defined 'route_select' option.

In the previous example, a client connected to '192.168.0.1' will be proxied
to 'host1' and, if the host is not reachable, to 'host2'. If a client does not
connect to '192.168.0.1' or '192.168.0.2' it will be proxied to the sshd
daemon listening on port 4222 on 'host5'.

An associative array *ssh* specifies the SSH options:

*exe*::
	path or command to use for the SSH client ('ssh' by default).

*args*::
	a list of arguments for the SSH client. Its default value is: '["-q",
	"-Y"]'.

Each of the previous parameters can be overridden for a group thanks to the
*groups* associative array.

For example if we want to save debug messages for the 'foo' group we define:

	groups:
	    foo:
	        debug: true

Routes, environment or SSH options can also be defined:

	groups:
	    foo:
	        routes:
	            default: [hostx]
	
	        ssh:
	            args: ["-vvv", "-Y"]

The routes are fully overridden and not merged with previous defined ones.

If a user belongs to several groups and these groups are defined in the
configuration file, each setting can be overridden by the next group.

For example, if a user is in the 'admin' and 'users' groups the logs will be
in '/var/log/sshproxy/admin/\{user}.log' with the following configuration:

	groups:
	    users:
	        log: /var/log/sshproxy/users/{user}.log
	
	    admin:
	        log: /var/log/sshproxy/admin/{user}.log

We can also override the parameters for a specific user with the 'users'
associative array.

For example if we want to save debug messages for the 'foo' user we
define:

	users:
	    foo:
	        debug: true

As for the groups, we can modify routes, environment or SSH options:

	users:
	    foo:
	        ssh:
	            args: ["-vvv", "-Y"]

The parameters defined for a user are the last applied and therefore always
override the settings defined by in the 'groups' associative array.
