NAME
----
sshproxy - proxy SSH connections on a gateway

SYNOPSIS
--------
*sshproxy* ['OPTIONS'] ['config']

DESCRIPTION
-----------

'sshproxy' is used on a gateway to proxy SSH connections.

If the SSH server sets the 'SSH_USER_AUTH' environment variable (see
'ExposeAuthInfo' in openssh's 'sshd_config'), 'sshproxy' uses it to get the
'force-command' directive of the client's signed ssh public key. If a
'force-command' is found, it is used as an argument to the 'ssh' command
forked by sshproxy. Otherwise, the 'SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND' environment variable
is used as the argument to the 'ssh' command.

OPTIONS
-------

*-version*::
	Show version number and exit.

INSTALLATION
------------

* Configure '/etc/sshproxy/sshproxy.yaml' to suit your needs.

* Modify the OpenSSH daemon configuration '/etc/ssh/sshd_config' by adding:

	ForceCommand /sbin/sshproxy

'etcd' can be used to make 'sshproxy' stateful. If it is the case,
*sshproxyctl*(8) can display and modify states stored in etcd.

FILES
-----
/etc/sshproxy/sshproxy.yaml::
	Contains configuration (see *sshproxy.yaml*(5) for details).
