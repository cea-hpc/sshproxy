NAME
----
sshproxy-replay - Show recorded session from sshproxy

SYNOPSIS
--------
*sshproxy-replay* ['OPTIONS'] 'files' ...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
'sshproxy-replay' is a tool to read a session recorded with *sshproxy*(8).

First it displays the header information with the file format version number
and the original command sent to the destination.

If no option is specified each record is successively printed on the standard
output.

Each record is preceded by a header with the following fields:

* The date if it is the first record or the time delta from the first record
for all the other records.
* The direction of the data represented by the following symbols:
`-->`::
	data written on the standard input (i.e. keystrokes typed the user),
`<--`::
	data written on the standard output,
`<==`::
	data written on the standard error.
* The record length.

The raw data is displayed in an hexadecimal dump on two-columns similar to the
result of the familiar 'hexdump -C' command.

-------

*-replay*::
	Live replay a session.

*-version*::
	Show version number and exit.
