NAME
----
sshproxy-dumpd - Network daemon to save sessions recorded by sshproxy

SYNOPSIS
--------
*sshproxy-dumpd* ['OPTIONS']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
'sshproxy-dumpd' listens on a TCP socket and reads packets sent by
*sshproxy*(8).

It parses the header to find some information (such as the user name, start
time, IP addresses and ports, etc.) and saves each dump in a subdirectory
named after the user. The filename is the concatenation of the start time and
a unique session identifier calculated with some of the header information
(it is the same one used by *sshproxy*(8) in its log).

OPTIONS
-------

*-listen=":5555"*::
	Listen on this address (format '[host]:port'). It listens on ':5555'
	by default.

*-output=""*::
	Output directory where dumps will be written. This options is
	mandatory.

*-version*::
	Show version number and exit.
