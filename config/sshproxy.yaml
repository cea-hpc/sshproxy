# Where raw dumps are written. Only interactive sessions are dumped.
# Default is empty.
# It can be a path which can (and should) contain one or more of the following
# patterns:
#   - '{user}' replaced by the user login
#   - '{sid}' replaced by the unique session id
#   - '{time}' replaced by the connection starting time (e.g.
#     "2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00").
# The subdirectories will be created if needed.
# For example: "/var/lib/sshproxy/dumps/{user}/{time}-{sid}.dump"
# It can also be "etcd", in order to store stats into etcd
# It can also be a network address where to send dumps if specified as
# 'TCP:host:port' (the TCP is case sensitive), e.g. 'TCP:collector:5555'.
#dump: ""

# Maximum amount of bytes of a dump. Setting the 'dump_limit_window' option

# limit).

# Duration of a dump measurement window. "0" by default, the string can contain
# a unit suffix such as 'h', 'm' and 's' (e.g. "2m30s"). When set to "0", a
# dump will stop once it's too big (and the dump's file descriptor will be
# closed. When set to a duration, the dump will pause when there is too much
# data transferred in the current window (or the previous), and will resume
# when few enough data are transferred during the previous window and the
# current one. This option is only useful when the 'dump_limit_size' option is
# set.

# Interval at which basic statistics of transferred bytes are logged.
# "0" by default (i.e. disabled), the string can contain a unit suffix such as

# 'dump' option is set.

# Interval at which bandwidth is updated in etcd. "0" by default (i.e.
# disabled), the string can contain a unit suffix such as 'h', 'm' and 's'

# set.

# Routes definition.
# The key is the service name (only used for display). The special service name
# "default" can be used to define a default route and does not need the source
# key. The source value is the IP address or DNS name of the listening SSH
# daemon (with an optional port). The dest value is an array of destination
# hosts (with an optional port). The route_select value defines how the host
# destination will be chosen. It can be "ordered" (the default), "random",
# "connections" or "bandwidth". If "ordered", the hosts are tried in the order
# listed until a successful connection is made. The list is first randomly
# sorted if "random" is specified (i.e. a poor-man load-balancing algorithm).
# If "connections", the hosts with less connections from the user have
# priority, then the hosts with less global connections, and in case of a draw,
# the selection is random. For "bandwidth", it's the same as "connections", but
# based on the bandwidth used, with a rollback on connections (which is
# frequent for new simultaneous connections). Finally, the mode value defines
# the stickiness of a connection. It can be "sticky" or "balanced". If
# "sticky", then all connections of a user will be made on the same destination
# host. If "balanced", the route_select algorithm will be used for every
# connection.
#routes:
#    service1:
#        source: ["192.168.0.1"]
#        dest: [host1, host2]
#    service2:
#        source: ["192.168.0.2"]
#        dest: [host3, host4]

# Each option can be overridden for a Unix group of users.
# If a user is in multiple groups and these groups are defined in the
# configuration, the configuration of a previous group will be overridden by the
# next ones.
# The parameters defined in a "users" option (see below) will be applied last
# and override groups parameters.
