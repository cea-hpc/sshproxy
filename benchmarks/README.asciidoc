Benchmark Tests
===============

Launching the benchmark tests
-----------------------------

From the root directory of this repository, just run +make benchmark+. It will
create a directory benchmarks/results, and store the results in it.

Consistency
-----------

Benchmarks are only usable if they are consistently run on the same computer,
and with no other resource-consuming program running at the same time. Keep
this in mind in order to have consistent results.

Analyzing the benchmark tests
-----------------------------

You can use +benchstat+ (https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/perf/cmd/benchstat)
for analyzing the results. Just pass the result file name as an argument in
order to see the results. You can even compare different results by passing
more than one file as arguments.
