What is sshproxy?
-----------------

sshproxy is used on a gateway to transparently proxy a user SSH connection on
the gateway to an internal host via SSH. scp, sftp, rsync, etc. are supported.

sshproxy defines routes which bind an SSH listening address to a pool of
destination hosts. It can then choose the first available destination or
load-balance the connections with a simple round-robin algorithm.

Because of its design sshproxy is stateless (it is launched as a
+ForceCommand+ by sshd). It can be made stateful by using etcd allowing to:

- remember users connections and always connects a user to the same
  destination while a connection to this destination is alive,
- periodically check if destination hosts are alive.

States stored in etcd can be displayed or modified with the +sshproxyctl+
command.

sshproxy can be configured to monitor SSH sessions and either to save them in
files or to send them to the very simple +sshproxy-dumpd+ daemon. Sessions can
be replayed with the +sshproxy-replay+ command.

Compilation
-----------

Install the Go compiler suite: see http://golang.org/doc/install for details.

Define and export the +$GOPATH+ directory where the source code will be
unpacked (e.g. '$HOME/go'):

	$ export GOPATH=$HOME/go
	$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/cea-hpc
	$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/cea-hpc
	$ tar xvJf sshproxy-X.Y.Z.tar.xz

Compile everything:

	$ make

Installation
------------

Install binaries and manpages:

	# make install

+sshproxy+ and +sshproxy-dumpd+ are installed in +/usr/sbin+, +sshproxyctl+
and +sshproxy-replay+ in +/usr/bin+.

Configuration
-------------

There are commented configuration files in the +config+ directory.

Configure +/etc/sshproxy/sshproxy.yaml+ to suit your needs.

Modify the SSH daemon configuration +/etc/ssh/sshd_config+ by adding:

	ForceCommand /usr/sbin/sshproxy
